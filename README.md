Java multi threading using BlockingQueue

This is a Producer-Consumer pattern implemented in Java using the very handy ArrayBlockingQueue class.  Producer-Consumer is a highly useful design pattern that many multi-threaded applications will want to make use of. I made this in uni during an assignment about the lower level synchronised keyword.
